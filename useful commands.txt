How to Read the Video and Covert it to Bits
(This will not work on all MATLAb versions but the idea should be the same)

%load video
V = aviread('Stephan.avi');
Nof_Frames = length(V);

for Frame=1:Nof_Frames

%Red Components of the Frame
R=V(Frame).cdata(:,:,1); 
%Green Components of the Frame
G=V(Frame).cdata(:,:,2); 
%Blue Components of the Frame
B=V(Frame).cdata(:,:,3); 

R=reshape(R,1,prod(size(R))); %we reshape to put the red as a stream of 1 row 
G=reshape(G,1,prod(size(G))); %we reshape to put the green as a stream of 1 row 
B=reshape(R,1,prod(size(B))); %we reshape to put the blue as a stream of 1 row 

R=double(R);%convert red map-8 to decimal
G=double(G);%convert green map-8 to decimal
B=double(B);%convert blue map-8 to decimal

Rbin=de2bi(R,8);%convert red decimal to binary in 8 bits
Gbin=de2bi(G,8);%convert green decimal to binary in 8 bits
Bbin=de2bi(B,8);%convert blue decimal to binary in 8 bits

end
